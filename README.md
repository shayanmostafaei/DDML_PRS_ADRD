## Overview
This repository provides code for constructing polygenic risk scores (PRS) for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) using a Bayesian variational autoencoder-based deep learning model (DDML). The model was developed and evaluated using data from the UK Biobank. 

## Data or Resources
For more details on the genetic data in the UK Biobank, see [UK Biobank Genetic Data](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/ukb/label.cgi?id=263).
