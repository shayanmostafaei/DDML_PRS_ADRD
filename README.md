Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for Predicting Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in UK Biobank 
Overview: 
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have significant potential for predicting Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, existing models face limitations such as inadequate preclinical prediction, unclear accuracy compared to APOE genotype alone, and variability due to age and sex. This project aims to enhance PRS predictive accuracy by comparing three computational methodologies:
•	Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (DDML)
•	SBayesR
•	Clumping and Thresholding (C_T)
Why This Project is Useful?
This study advances the field of genetic risk prediction by:
•	Improving the accuracy of PRS for ADRD prediction using ML algorithms.
•	Evaluating multiple computational approaches to determine their effectiveness.
•	Incorporating polygenic hazard scores (PHS) to account for age.
•	Providing insights into the impact of age and sex on PRS performance.
Results & Evaluation: 
The performance of the PRS models was assessed using:
•	Time-dependent AUC for ADRD risk prediction.
•	C-index to evaluate survival models.
•	Hazard Ratios (HR) to measure effect size.
•	A holdout validation method (2/3 training, 1/3 testing split) for machine learning models.
