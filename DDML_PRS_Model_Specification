# Supplementary Table: DDML_PRS Model Specification

**Model run ID**  
`DDML_PRS_final`

## Model architecture (encoder / decoder / latent)
- **Input:** 80 GWAS-significant SNPs preselected from Bellenguez et al. (2022), as described in the main manuscript.  
- **Encoder architecture:** Three fully connected layers with ReLU activations (512 → 256 → 128 units).  
- **Latent space:** 50-dimensional latent representation. The encoder outputs a mean and log-variance vector; latent variables are sampled using the reparameterization trick. 
- **Decoder architecture:** Symmetric mirror of encoder (128 → 256 → 512) to reconstruct genotype input.  
- **Scalar PRS derivation:** The posterior mean of the 50-dimensional latent representation is transformed into a single continuous scalar score (DDML_PRS), which is used as the polygenic risk score in downstream prediction models.

## Bayesian priors & KL term
- **GWAS priors:**  External GWAS summary statistics from from Jansen et al., that do not include UKB participants, were used to inform prior distributions, providing biologically motivated regularization of the latent representation.
- **KL divergence:** Linear KL-weight annealing from 0 → 1 over the first 20 epochs. 
- **KL annealing:** Linear KL-weight annealing from 0 → 1 over the first 20 epochs. 

## Training, validation, and data splitting
- **Training / test split:** Random split — Training = 66.7%, Test = 33.3% of the full cohort (n = 276,566 participants).
- **Internal validation:** 10% of the training set held out for monitoring (validation ELBO and validation AUC) and early stopping.
- **Early stopping:** Monitored on validation ELBO. Patience = Monitored on validation ELBO. 

## Final hyperparameters
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Learning rate:** 0.001  
- **Batch size:** 256  
- **Epochs (max):** 100  
- **Latent dimension:** 50  
- **Weight decay / L2:** none  
- **Dropout:** none
- **Explicit weight decay / L2 regularization:** none

Regularization is provided implicitly through GWAS-informed priors and early stopping.

## APOE region handling
- ** Genome build:** hg19
- ** APOE region definition:** chr19: 44–46 Mb
- ** With APOE region:** SNPs within this window included in PRS construction
- ** Without APOE region:** All SNPs within this window removed prior to PRS construction

APOE ε2 / ε3 / ε4 genotype variables were derived from rs7412 and rs429358 and were included only as downstream covariates where stated.

## Performance metrics (independent test set)
- ** PRS-only models (no covariates):** DDML_PRS (with APOE region):AUC = 0.691 (95% CI: 0.68–0.70)
- ** PRS-only models (no covariates):** DDML_PRS (without APOE region): AUC = 0.654 (95% CI: 0.65–0.67)

## PRS + covariates models (downstream regression)
- ** DDML_PRS + APOE + age + sex + PCs:** AUC = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.83–0.85)

## Subgroup and time-dependent analyses
- ** Peak subgroup performance:** Selected age-stratified analyses yielded AUCs up to ~0.85
- ** Proportional hazards models:** Overall C-index (PRS + APOE + age + sex): 0.840

## Reproducibility and stability
- ** Number of independent runs: 5 (distinct random seeds)**
- ** Per-seed test AUCs (PRS + APOE + age + sex + 10-PCs):**
  - Run_1 (seed 123): 0.832  
  - Run_2 (seed 12321): 0.835  
  - Run_3 (seed 42): 0.843  
  - Run_4 (seed 2024): 0.839  
  - Run_5 (seed 99): 0.845  
  - **Mean ± SD:** 0.839 ± 0.005

## Notes on pre-specification and pilot checks
- Model architecture and hyperparameters were fixed a priori based on prior Bayesian VAE applications in genomics.
- Limited exploratory runs using training data only were performed to confirm numerical stability and convergence.
- No hyperparameter optimization or model selection was performed using the independent test set.
